[Generalized Galois Theories & Classical Algebraic Geometry](https://whendustsettles.github.io/GaloisAG/From%20Galois%20Theory%20to%20Galois%20Theories.pdf) : My undergraduate thesis, prepared under Prof. Rupam Barman. There are two parts, the first one deals with classical and general Galois theories. The latter deal with an introduction to algebraic geometry.
